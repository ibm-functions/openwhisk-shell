# Importing a plugin

To import a plugin into your own wskng, add your repo to
`app/plugins/package.json`, or perform an `npm install` from within
the `app/plugins` directory.

# Structure of a plugin

A plugin consists of three parts, some optional.

  1. Registering as a listener for commands. This is done by calling 
  ```
  commandTree.listen('/sample/echo', sayHello, { docs: 'Say hello!' })
  ```
  
  As a result of this registration, the wskng repl will respond to `sample echo` with the return value of the `sayHello` handler.
  
  2. Command handlers. Handlers can return plain strings, which will
 then be printed in the CLI portion of the UI.
 
  More sophisticated examples can return Promises of values. If the
  value, or promise thereof, evaluates to a whisk entity, then the
  sidecar will be opened to show it.
 
  If you want the repl only to print "ok", then `return true`. Lastly,
  if you want the repl to print an error string in red text, then
  `throw new Error("error message")`
  
  3. Optionally, a plugin may also export a programmatic API. This API
     export is accomplished by returning a structure. For example:
     ```
     module.exports = (commandTree, prequire) => {
        return {
            sayHello: sayHello
        }
     }
     ```

  Now, other plugins can programmatically invoke your features, rather
  than having to rely on a repl-style of invocation. To import the
  programmatic API of some other plugin, use the `prequire` method. For example
  ```
      const sayHello = prequire('/wsk-sample-plugin').sayHello
  ```
